Changelog for your website.


## Instalation

1. Profit !?!

## Type of improvements are:

* New
* Change
* Bug-Fix
* Improuvment

## Why?

It is a simple system for simple people. When researching for a already done system like this the problem was in most cases people want 5-10-15$ a month for something really simple but the difference is that I have an editor to do it online.( Sorry! I don't want to offend anybody!) This version of the system is mostly all we need and there will be more improvement for future uses.
