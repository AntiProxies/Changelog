[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/896e9dee-d49f-46a4-82f9-61f63c973903/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/antiproxies-changelog/deploys)


Changelog for your website.


## Instalation

1. It is a plain HTML based website. We will make it better by getting the information from a special file but not right now.
2. Profit !?!

## Type of improvements are:

* New - New features
* Change - Changes to already existing features
* Bug-Fix - Fixing the "bad guys" (bugs)
* Improvement - Making a feature even better than before.

## Why?

It is a simple system for simple people. When researching for a already done system like there were two main problems:
* It costs 5-25$ a month for something really simple but the difference is that I have an editor to do it online. Sorry! I don't want to offend anybody, but even Github has it and I can do the same here. Even adding a simple thing as a custom URL or GA I needed to get a higher tier account on already paying account.
* It is something really complex which needs a server, database and etc. It is just a lot for something this simple.

 This version of the system is mostly all we need and there will be more improvement in the future..
